# Logo Size Standardization

## Latest Changes

1. **Adjusted Footer Logo Size**
   - Made footer logo the same size as navbar logo (180px × 48px)
   - Added fixed height container (h-12) to match navbar implementation
   - Maintained consistent sizing and appearance across both header and footer

## Current Implementation

1. **Navbar Logo**
   - Using: `/public/images/logo.svg`
   - Dimensions: 180px × 48px
   - Container height: 12px

2. **Footer Logo**
   - Using: `/public/images/footerLogo.svg`
   - Dimensions: 180px × 48px (updated to match navbar)
   - Container height: 12px (updated to match navbar)

## Benefits of Standardization

- Consistent brand presentation throughout the site
- Unified user experience with matched element sizing
- More cohesive design while still optimizing for different backgrounds
- Professional appearance with attention to detail

## Technical Details

- Both logos use the same dimensions and container styles
- Both use SVG format for optimal display
- Each optimized for its background (light header vs. dark footer)

## Testing

To verify the changes:

1. Run the development server with `npm run dev`
2. Compare the logo sizes in the header and footer
3. Ensure they appear to be the same size and maintain the same proportions
4. Verify proper display on different screen sizes

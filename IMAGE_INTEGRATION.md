# Image Integration Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Added Image Component to Homepage**
   - Added a new `Image` component from Next.js to replace the placeholder in the hero section
   - Configured the image with responsive sizing and proper attributes
   - Added `priority` attribute to ensure the hero image loads quickly
   - Used a fill container with object-fit to ensure proper image display

## Technical Details

- **Image Path**: `/public/images/homeImage1.png`
- **Image Implementation**: Using Next.js Image component with fill and object-fit
- **Styling**: Maintained rounded corners, shadow, and border from the original placeholder

## Next Steps

1. **Additional Image Integration**
   - Consider adding an image for the About section placeholder
   - Upload new images to `/public/images/` folder
   - Follow the same pattern to replace other placeholders

2. **Image Optimization Considerations**
   - The Next.js Image component automatically handles optimization
   - Consider adding additional image sizes for different viewports if needed
   - Ensure images are properly compressed for optimal loading performance

## Testing

To verify the changes:

1. Run the development server with `npm run dev`
2. Check that the hero image displays correctly
3. Test on different screen sizes to ensure responsive behavior
4. Verify image quality and loading speed

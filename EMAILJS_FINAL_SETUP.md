# EmailJS Final Configuration Steps

The EmailJS integration for your Mvono Consultants contact form has been successfully set up!

## Current Configuration

Your EmailJS integration is now configured with:

- **Service ID**: `service_mrlpiud` (SMTP service)
- **Template ID**: `template_0dqnbej`
- **Public Key**: `tHis0A6-Y-Z0QThqW`

## What's Been Implemented

1. **Contact Form**: The contact form has been updated to use EmailJS for sending messages
2. **EmailJS Library**: A helper library has been created at `lib/emailjs.js` for easy reuse
3. **Environment Variables**: Configuration values have been added to your `.env` and `.env.local` files

## How It Works

1. When a user submits the contact form:
   - The data is collected and formatted
   - EmailJS sends the message through your configured SMTP service
   - The user receives a success message when the email is sent

2. Form data is mapped to these template variables:
   - `from_name` - Sender's name
   - `from_email` - Sender's email
   - `phone` - Phone number
   - `company` - Company name
   - `service` - Service of interest
   - `message` - Message content
   - `to_name` - "Mvono Consultants" (hidden field)

## If You Need to Make Changes

1. **To change the template**: Create a new template in EmailJS and update the template ID in:
   - `app/contact/page.jsx`
   - `lib/emailjs.js`
   - `.env` and `.env.local` files

2. **To use a different service**: Set up a new service in EmailJS and update the service ID in the same locations.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the contact form:

1. **Check the browser console** for any error messages
2. **Verify your EmailJS credentials** to ensure they are correct
3. **Test your EmailJS service** directly through the EmailJS dashboard
4. **Ensure your template variables** match the field names in your form

## Maintenance Notes

- The free EmailJS plan includes 200 emails per month
- Emails are sent from the account configured in your EmailJS SMTP service
- The form data is processed entirely client-side (no server required)

## Missing Images

There are still some missing images that are showing errors in the console:
- `/images/logo.svg`
- `/images/footerLogo.svg`
- `/images/homeImage1.png`
- `/images/homeImage2.png`
- `favicon.ico`

You can fix these by adding the appropriate images to your public directory.

# Performance Optimization Guide

## Overview

This document outlines procedures for monitoring and optimizing the performance of the Mvono Consultants management system. Regular performance maintenance ensures the system remains responsive, reliable, and efficient for all users.

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Page Load Times**
   - Target: < 2 seconds for dashboard
   - Target: < 1 second for standard pages
   - Target: < 3 seconds for report generation

2. **Database Response Times**
   - Target: < 100ms for standard queries
   - Target: < 500ms for complex reports
   - Target: < 1 second for full-text searches

3. **Memory Usage**
   - Target: < 70% average utilization
   - Alert threshold: > 85% for more than 5 minutes

4. **CPU Utilization**
   - Target: < 60% average utilization
   - Alert threshold: > 80% for more than 10 minutes

5. **Concurrent User Capacity**
   - Target: Support 50 concurrent users without degradation
   - Test quarterly with load testing tools

### Monitoring Tools

1. **Vercel Analytics Dashboard**
   - Access through Vercel project dashboard
   - Check Edge Network performance
   - Monitor deployments and errors

2. **Database Monitoring**
   - Use PostgreSQL monitoring tools
   - Track query performance
   - Monitor connection pooling

3. **Application Performance Monitoring**
   - New Relic integration
   - Track transaction timing
   - Identify bottlenecks

## Optimization Procedures

### Database Optimization

#### Scheduled Maintenance (Monthly)

1. **Index Optimization**
   - Run `REINDEX DATABASE mvono_db;`
   - Check for unused indexes
   - Add missing indexes for common queries

2. **Table Statistics Update**
   - Run `ANALYZE VERBOSE;`
   - Update PostgreSQL query planner statistics

3. **Database Vacuum**
   - Run `VACUUM FULL;` during off-hours
   - Reclaim storage and update statistics

#### Query Optimization (As Needed)

1. Review slow query log weekly
2. Optimize problematic queries:
   - Rewrite inefficient queries
   - Add appropriate indexes
   - Consider materialized views for complex reports

### Application Optimization

#### Frontend Performance

1. **Asset Optimization**
   - Verify proper caching headers
   - Confirm image optimization
   - Check bundle sizes with Webpack analysis

2. **Component Rendering**
   - Review React component memoization
   - Check for unnecessary re-renders
   - Optimize state management

#### API Performance

1. **Endpoint Optimization**
   - Review response times for all endpoints
   - Implement pagination for large data sets
   - Optimize data sent over the network

2. **Caching Strategy**
   - Configure SWR caching properly
   - Implement server-side caching where appropriate
   - Set appropriate cache invalidation strategies

### Infrastructure Optimization

1. **Vercel Configuration**
   - Review serverless function settings
   - Monitor cold starts and optimize
   - Consider premium plans for enhanced performance

2. **CDN Configuration**
   - Ensure proper cache configurations
   - Review geographic distribution
   - Monitor cache hit ratios

## Scaling Considerations

### Vertical Scaling

- Increase database resources when consistently seeing high utilization
- Upgrade database plan when approaching connection limits
- Consider dedicated database instances for improved performance

### Horizontal Scaling

- Add read replicas for reporting workloads
- Implement caching layer with Redis
- Consider microservices architecture for specific high-load modules

## Troubleshooting Performance Issues

### Sudden Performance Degradation

1. Check recent deployments or changes
2. Review current system load (database, memory, CPU)
3. Check for unusual traffic patterns or potential DoS
4. Verify database connection pool health
5. Check for database locks or long-running queries

### Gradual Performance Decline

1. Review growth of data volume
2. Check database index health
3. Analyze query patterns for changes
4. Review user growth and access patterns
5. Evaluate application code changes over time

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing Schedule

- **Quarterly**: Full system load test
- **After Major Updates**: Targeted testing of affected components
- **Annual**: Stress testing to determine breaking points

### Load Testing Procedure

1. Create testing environment mirroring production
2. Define test scenarios based on typical user workflows
3. Configure test for target concurrent users
4. Execute test during off-hours
5. Analyze results and identify bottlenecks
6. Implement improvements
7. Retest to verify enhancement

## Best Practices

### Database Best Practices

- Keep critical tables under 10 million rows when possible
- Implement table partitioning for large historical data
- Regularly review and optimize indexes
- Use connection pooling effectively
- Implement appropriate data archiving strategies

### Application Best Practices

- Minimize unnecessary re-renders in React components
- Implement effective client-side caching
- Use pagination for all list views
- Optimize image and asset delivery
- Implement progressive loading for complex dashboards

### API Best Practices

- Return only needed data fields
- Implement rate limiting for public endpoints
- Use compression for response data
- Implement appropriate caching strategies
- Document performance expectations for integrations

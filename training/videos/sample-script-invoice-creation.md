You'll now see the invoice list showing all existing invoices. To create a new invoice, click the "Create Invoice" button in the top-right corner.

### Section 2: Setting Up Basic Invoice Information (1 minute 30 seconds)

```
[NARRATOR]
Now we'll set up the basic information for our invoice.

[DEMONSTRATION CONTINUES]

First, select the client from the dropdown menu. You can start typing the client name to filter the list quickly.

Next, verify the invoice date, which defaults to today's date. You can change this if needed by clicking the calendar icon.

[HIGHLIGHT CALENDAR ICON]

Now, set the payment terms. Click the dropdown and select the appropriate option - we'll choose "Net 30" which means payment is due in 30 days.

[SHOW SELECTING "NET 30" FROM DROPDOWN]

Notice that the due date automatically calculates based on the invoice date and payment terms.

[HIGHLIGHT DUE DATE FIELD UPDATING]

If there's a client purchase order number, enter it in the "LPO Number" field. This helps the client match the invoice to their purchase records.

[SHOW TYPING "PO-2024-12345" IN LPO FIELD]

The invoice number is generated automatically following our standard format, but you can see it at the top of the form.

[HIGHLIGHT INVOICE NUMBER "MVC-2024-0042"]

[HIGHLIGHT AUTO-FILLED FIELDS]

Next, enter the quantity. Since this is a single audit, we'll enter "1".

[SHOW ENTERING "1" IN QUANTITY FIELD]

The line total calculates automatically by multiplying the quantity by the unit price.

To apply VAT to the invoice, check the "Apply VAT (16%)" box.

[SHOW CLICKING BACK TO INVOICES]

You'll see your new invoice in the list with a status of "Pending" since it has been sent but not yet paid.

[HIGHLIGHT NEW INVOICE IN LIST WITH PENDING STATUS]

When you receive payment from the client, you need to record it. Click on the invoice to open it.

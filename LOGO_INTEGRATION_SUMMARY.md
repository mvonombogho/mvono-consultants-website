## Hero Section Logo Implementation Details:

```jsx
{/* Company Logo in Hero */}
<div className="mb-8 flex justify-center lg:justify-start">
  <div className="relative h-20 w-auto">
    <Image 
      src="/images/logo.svg" 
      alt="Mvono Consultants Logo" 
      width={240}
      height={80}
      className="h-full w-auto object-contain filter brightness-0 invert"
      priority
    />
  </div>
</div>
```

## Design Features:
- **Responsive**: Logo adjusts position based on screen size
- **Accessibility**: Proper alt text for screen readers
- **Performance**: Uses Next.js Image component with priority loading
- **Styling**: White filter applied for visibility on dark hero background
- **Consistent**: Matches overall design system and branding

## Result:
The website now has a cohesive brand presence with the Mvono Consultants logo prominently displayed in:
1. Hero section (new addition)
2. Navigation header (existing)
3. Footer (existing)

All pages maintain consistent navigation and footer implementation, ensuring a professional and unified user experience across the entire website.

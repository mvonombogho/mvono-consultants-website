# Dashboard Removal Guide

This guide will help you remove the dashboard functionality from the Mvono Consultants website.

## Approach

We've taken the following approach:

1. Removed dashboard-related directories and components
2. Updated the middleware.ts file to remove dashboard-related authentication logic 
3. Updated the root layout.jsx to remove AuthProvider
4. Updated the Navbar to remove login links
5. Updated package.json to remove dashboard-related dependencies

## Steps to Complete the Removal

### Option 1: Using the JavaScript Script (Windows)

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project root directory
2. Run the JavaScript removal script:

```bash
node scripts/remove-dashboard.js
```

3. Install updated dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server to verify changes:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Using the Bash Script (Linux/Mac)

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project root directory
2. Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/remove-dashboard.sh
```

3. Run the bash removal script:

```bash
./scripts/remove-dashboard.sh
```

4. Start the development server to verify changes:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Manual Verification

After running either script, please verify:

1. The website loads correctly without errors
2. Navigation works between all pages
3. There are no remaining links to dashboard or admin pages
4. No authentication or login functionality remains

## Key Files Modified

1. middleware.ts - Removed dashboard authentication logic
2. app/layout.jsx - Removed AuthProvider
3. components/shared/Navbar.jsx - Removed login links
4. package.json - Removed dashboard-related dependencies

## Development for Separate SaaS

As requested, you can now develop a separate SaaS application with the dashboard functionality. This clean separation will allow you to:

1. Keep the public-facing website simple and focused
2. Develop a more sophisticated SaaS application with its own authentication and features
3. Deploy and manage the two applications independently

## Next Steps

1. Commit these changes to your repository
2. Start development on your separate SaaS application for the dashboard functionality
3. Consider using a shared design system between both applications for brand consistency

# Emergency Response Procedures

## Overview

This document outlines emergency response procedures for critical system issues with the Mvono Consultants Management System. These procedures are designed to minimize downtime and data loss in emergency situations.

## Emergency Contact Information

**Primary Contacts:**

| Role | Name | Primary Contact | Secondary Contact |
|------|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| System Administrator | [Name] | [Phone] | [Email] |
| Database Administrator | [Name] | [Phone] | [Email] |
| Technical Lead | [Name] | [Phone] | [Email] |
| Project Manager | [Name] | [Phone] | [Email] |
| Infrastructure Provider | [Provider] | [Support Number] | [Support Portal] |

**Escalation Path:**

1. System Administrator
2. Database Administrator
3. Technical Lead
4. Project Manager
5. Infrastructure Provider Support

## Emergency Situations

The following scenarios are considered emergencies requiring immediate action:

1. **System Outage**: Complete system unavailability
2. **Data Corruption**: Critical data is corrupted or inconsistent
3. **Security Breach**: Confirmed or suspected security incident
4. **Database Failure**: Database is unavailable or experiencing severe performance issues
5. **Website Defacement**: Public-facing website is defaced or displaying inappropriate content

## Initial Response

### 1. Assess the Situation

- Confirm the nature and scope of the emergency
- Document when the issue was first noticed
- Identify the affected components or functionality
- Determine the potential impact on users and business operations

### 2. Notify Key Personnel

- Contact the primary emergency contact appropriate for the issue
- Provide clear, concise information about the issue
- Record who has been notified and when

### 3. Establish Communication Channel

- Create an emergency communication channel (e.g., dedicated Slack channel, video call)
- Ensure all team members know how to access this channel
- Designate a communication coordinator to keep stakeholders informed

### 4. Implement Immediate Mitigation

- Take immediate actions to prevent further damage
- For security incidents, consider isolating affected systems
- For database issues, prevent further writes if data corruption is suspected
- For system outages, check for obvious infrastructure issues

## Emergency Response Procedures by Scenario

### System Outage

1. **Verify Outage**
   - Check system status from multiple locations
   - Verify server and service status
   - Check for maintenance notices that may have been overlooked

2. **Check Infrastructure**
   - Verify server status in hosting dashboard
   - Check for resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, disk space)
   - Review recent deployment or configuration changes

3. **Restore Service**
   - Restart application services: `pm2 restart mvono-app`
   - If unsuccessful, restart the server
   - If hosted services are down, contact the infrastructure provider

4. **Restore from Backup (if necessary)**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/maintenance/scripts
   ./restore-from-backup.sh latest
   ```

### Data Corruption

1. **Contain the Issue**
   - Place the system in maintenance mode to prevent further corruption
   - ```bash
     cd /path/to/scripts
     ./toggle-maintenance-mode.sh on "Emergency maintenance in progress due to data issue. Please check back shortly."
     ```

2. **Assess Corruption Scope**
   - Identify affected tables and data
   - Run integrity checks on the database
   - Determine when corruption likely occurred

3. **Restore from Backup**
   - Identify the most recent backup before corruption
   - Restore the database from this backup
   - ```bash
     cd /path/to/maintenance/scripts
     ./restore-from-backup.sh [backup-timestamp]
     ```

4. **Data Reconciliation**
   - If possible, recover transactions lost since the backup
   - Apply missing transactions manually or through recovery scripts
   - Verify data integrity after restoration

### Security Breach

1. **Isolate Affected Systems**
   - Disable external access if breach is ongoing
   - ```bash
     # Update firewall rules to limit access
     sudo ufw default deny incoming
     sudo ufw allow from [trusted-ip] to any port 22
     sudo ufw enable
     ```

2. **Preserve Evidence**
   - Create forensic backups of affected systems
   - Capture logs before they rotate
   - Document all observed indicators of compromise
   - ```bash
     cd /path/to/maintenance/scripts
     ./capture-forensic-logs.sh
     ```

3. **Change Credentials**
   - Reset all system passwords
   - Revoke and reissue API keys and tokens
   - Update database credentials
   - ```bash
     cd /path/to/maintenance/scripts
     ./reset-all-credentials.sh
     ```

4. **Patch Vulnerabilities**
   - Identify and patch the vulnerability that was exploited
   - Apply any pending security updates
   - Verify fixes with security testing

### Database Failure

1. **Assess Database Status**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status postgresql
   sudo journalctl -u postgresql
   ```

2. **Check Database Logs**
   ```bash
   sudo tail -n 100 /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-14-main.log
   ```

3. **Restart Database Service**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart postgresql
   ```

4. **Check for Corruption**
   ```sql
   -- Run as postgres user
   psql -U postgres -d mvono_db -c "SELECT pg_database_size('mvono_db');"
   ```

5. **Restore from Backup (if necessary)**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/maintenance/scripts
   ./restore-from-backup.sh latest
   ```

### Website Defacement

1. **Take Website Offline**
   - Redirect to a simple maintenance page
   - ```bash
     cd /path/to/scripts
     ./toggle-maintenance-mode.sh on "Website temporarily unavailable for maintenance."
     ```

2. **Identify Compromise Method**
   - Check web server logs for unusual activity
   - Review recent content changes
   - Verify file integrity against known good copies

3. **Restore Clean Content**
   - Restore website files from backup
   - ```bash
     cd /path/to/maintenance/scripts
     ./restore-web-content.sh [backup-timestamp]
     ```

4. **Secure the Environment**
   - Change all access credentials
   - Apply security patches
   - Verify correct file permissions

## Post-Emergency Actions

### 1. Verify System Stability

- Monitor system for at least 24 hours after emergency response
- Verify all services are functioning correctly
- Check for any lingering issues or side effects

### 2. Document the Incident

- Create a detailed incident report including:
  - Timeline of events
  - Actions taken
  - Root cause analysis
  - Impact assessment
  - Preventive measures for the future

### 3. Conduct Post-Mortem

- Schedule a post-mortem meeting with all relevant stakeholders
- Review the incident handling process
- Identify areas for improvement
- Update emergency procedures based on lessons learned

### 4. Preventive Measures

- Implement preventive measures to avoid similar incidents
- Update monitoring to detect similar issues earlier
- Consider additional redundancy for critical components
- Review and update backup strategies if needed

## Recovery Testing

Emergency response procedures should be tested regularly:

- Conduct quarterly recovery drills
- Test restoration from backups to a test environment
- Verify emergency contact information is current
- Review and update this document at least annually

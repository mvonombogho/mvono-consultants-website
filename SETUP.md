## All Path Issues Fixed! ðŸŽ‰

I've fixed all remaining import path issues in the UI components:

1. Fixed path aliases in the following components:
   - Avatar component
   - Dropdown Menu component
   - Button component
   - Input component
   - Label component

2. Changed all `@/lib/utils` imports to direct relative paths:
   ```javascript
   // Changed from:
   import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
   
   // To:
   import { cn } from "../../lib/utils"
   ```

## How to Access Your Dashboard

Your dashboard should now work with no import errors. You can use these methods to access it:

### Method 1: Bypass Authentication (Recommended for Development)
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/login
2. Click the "Bypass Auth (Development Only)" button
3. You'll be immediately redirected to the dashboard

### Method 2: NextAuth Login Form
- The form is pre-filled with test credentials
- Any credentials will work in development mode

## Understanding the Issue

The path alias problem was caused by:

1. **Inconsistent path resolution**: Next.js was having trouble resolving the `@/` path aliases in various components
2. **Component interdependencies**: UI components were importing other components and utilities using path aliases
3. **Case sensitivity**: Some imports might have had case sensitivity issues

## How This Was Fixed

1. All imports now use direct relative paths (`../../`) instead of path aliases (`@/`)
2. Components that depend on the `cn` utility from `lib/utils` now use relative paths
3. All component references are consistent across the project

## Continuing Development

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Access the application**:
   - Website: http://localhost:3000
   - Login: http://localhost:3000/login 
   - Dashboard: http://localhost:3000/dashboard (after login)

3. **Maintaining the fixes**:
   - Continue using relative imports for components
   - Be consistent with file paths throughout the project
   - Restart the development server after making changes to import paths

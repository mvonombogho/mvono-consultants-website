# Implementation Plan - MongoDB & AWS S3

## Phase 1: Initial Setup (Completed)
- [x] Configure MongoDB connection
- [x] Set up AWS S3 client and services
- [x] Create Document model for MongoDB
- [x] Implement file upload middleware
- [x] Create API endpoints for document management
- [x] Develop UI components for document management
- [x] Add document section to dashboard

## Phase 2: Deployment & Production Setup (Next Steps)
- [ ] Create AWS S3 bucket "mvono-consultants-bucket" in eu-west-1 region
- [ ] Configure CORS settings for S3 bucket to allow uploads from your domain
- [ ] Create IAM user with appropriate S3 permissions (s3:PutObject, s3:GetObject, s3:DeleteObject)
- [ ] Update AWS credentials in production environment variables
- [ ] Set up MongoDB Atlas cluster for production database
- [ ] Configure database backups and monitoring
- [ ] Implement proper security policies for document access

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future Enhancements)
- [ ] Implement document versioning
- [ ] Add document preview capabilities for common file types
- [ ] Create document sharing functionality with access controls
- [ ] Implement advanced search with full-text search capabilities
- [ ] Add document categorization and tagging system
- [ ] Integrate with other services (e.g., document signing, OCR)
- [ ] Create document workflows (approval, review processes)
- [ ] Implement document analytics (views, downloads, etc.)

## Phase 4: Optimization & User Experience (Final Improvements)
- [ ] Performance optimization for large file uploads
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for document lists
- [ ] Add drag-and-drop upload functionality
- [ ] Create mobile-responsive document viewer
- [ ] Implement batch operations for documents (bulk delete, move, tag)
- [ ] Add document collaboration features
- [ ] Create user training materials and documentation

## Notes for Development Team
1. When implementing S3 in production, create a bucket with appropriate lifecycle policies to manage storage costs
2. For improved security, consider implementing server-side encryption for S3
3. Make sure to properly configure CORS settings to prevent unauthorized uploads
4. For MongoDB in production, use MongoDB Atlas with proper network security settings
5. Implement proper error handling and logging for file operations
6. Consider implementing content moderation for uploaded files if necessary
7. Use AWS CloudFront or similar CDN for efficient file delivery

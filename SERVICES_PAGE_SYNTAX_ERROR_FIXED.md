# Services Page Syntax Error - FIXED ✅

## Issue Identified
The services page had a syntax error causing compilation failure with the message:
```
Error: Expression expected
Expected ',', got 'ref'
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by malformed JSX structure in the return statement, likely due to incomplete or corrupted edits when adding the Header and Footer components.

## Fix Applied
**File**: `app/services/page.tsx`

**Solution**: Completely rewrote the file with proper JSX structure:

### ✅ **Corrected Structure**:
```tsx
return (
  <>
    <Header />
    <div ref={pageRef} className="min-h-screen pt-20 pb-20">
      {/* Hero Section */}
      <div className="bg-blue-900 text-white py-20">
        {/* Hero content */}
      </div>
      
      {/* Services Grid */}
      <div className="container mx-auto px-4 py-16">
        {/* Services content */}
      </div>
      
      {/* Call to Action */}
      <div className="bg-gray-50 py-16">
        {/* CTA content */}
      </div>
    </div>
    <Footer />
  </>
);
```

### ✅ **Key Fixes**:
1. **Proper React Fragment**: Used `<>` and `</>` correctly
2. **Correct JSX nesting**: All components properly nested
3. **Maintained functionality**: All original services, animations, and styling preserved
4. **Added Header/Footer**: Both components properly integrated

### ✅ **Features Preserved**:
- All 8 service cards with descriptions and features
- GSAP animations for hero and service cards
- Responsive grid layout
- Call-to-action section
- All existing styling and functionality

## Testing
The file should now compile without errors. Run the development server to verify:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\Admin\Documents\mvono-consultants-website-main"
npm run dev
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000/services` to confirm the page loads correctly.

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Services page syntax error resolved, all functionality preserved.

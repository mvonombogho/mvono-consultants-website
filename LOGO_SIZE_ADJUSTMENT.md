# Logo Size Adjustment

## Changes Made

1. **Reduced Logo Size in Navbar**
   - Decreased dimensions from 220px × 64px to 180px × 48px
   - Reduced container height from 16px to 12px
   - Maintained SVG format for quality and scalability

2. **Reduced Logo Size in Footer**
   - Decreased dimensions from 200px × 60px to 160px × 48px
   - Maintained spacing and positioning 

## Technical Details

- **Logo Path**: Still using `/public/images/logo.svg`
- **Implementation**: Using Next.js Image component with adjusted dimensions
- **Modified Files**:
  - `components/shared/Navbar.jsx`
  - `components/shared/Footer.jsx`

## Design Considerations

- Found a better balance between logo visibility and overall layout harmony
- Logo is still prominently displayed but doesn't overwhelm the navigation
- Maintained consistent scaling between navbar and footer
- Preserved all the benefits of SVG format (scalability, performance)

## Next Steps

1. **Fine-tuning**
   - Review the website at various screen sizes to ensure the logo displays well
   - Consider further adjustments if needed based on design feedback

## Testing

To verify the changes:

1. Run the development server with `npm run dev`
2. Check that the logo displays correctly at the new size
3. Test responsiveness across different device sizes

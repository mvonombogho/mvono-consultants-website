# Contact Form Setup - Simple & Reliable Solution

This guide will help you set up a reliable contact form that delivers messages to your sales@mvonoconsultants.com email address.

## The Simplest Solution - Formspree

I recommend using Formspree, a free and reliable form-to-email service that requires no backend setup:

1. **Create a Formspree account**:
   - Go to [https://formspree.io/](https://formspree.io/) and sign up
   - The free plan gives you 50 submissions per month

2. **Create a new form**:
   - Click "New Form"
   - Name your form (e.g., "Mvono Contact Form")
   - Configure the form to send emails to sales@mvonoconsultants.com
   - Save the form

3. **Get your form endpoint**:
   - Formspree will provide you with a unique form endpoint URL
   - It looks like: `https://formspree.io/f/xxxxxxxx`

4. **Update your contact page**:
   - Open `app/contact/page.jsx`
   - Find this line (near line 32):
     ```javascript
     const response = await fetch('https://formspree.io/f/your-formspree-endpoint', {
     ```
   - Replace `your-formspree-endpoint` with your actual Formspree endpoint

5. **Test the form**:
   - Start your development server: `npm run dev`
   - Go to your contact page
   - Fill out and submit the form
   - Check your sales@mvonoconsultants.com inbox for the test email

## Alternative Solutions

If you prefer to use EmailJS as originally attempted:

### EmailJS Option:

1. **Set up a Zoho integration in EmailJS**:
   - In your EmailJS dashboard, set up a Zoho integration
   - Get your service ID, template ID, and public key
   - Update the contact page code to use EmailJS

### Direct API Option (for developers):

If you have development experience, you can also:

1. **Create a Next.js API route**:
   - Set up a Nodemailer-based API endpoint
   - Configure it with your Zoho SMTP settings
   - Update the form to call this API endpoint

## Why Formspree Is Recommended

Formspree is recommended because:

1. **No server configuration** - Works without complex SMTP settings
2. **Reliable delivery** - Built specifically for contact forms
3. **Simple setup** - Takes less than 5 minutes
4. **Free tier** - Includes 50 submissions per month
5. **No dependencies** - No need to install additional packages

Once your form is set up with Formspree, it will reliably deliver messages to your sales@mvonoconsultants.com email address without any complicated configuration.

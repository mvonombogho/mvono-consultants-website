# Next.js 14 Upgrade & Vercel Deployment Fix

## Problem Solved
The Vercel deployment was failing due to dependency conflicts between:
- Next.js 13.5.6 (current version)
- next-sanity 9.12.0 (requires Next.js ^14.2 || ^15.0.0-0)

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated package.json
- **Next.js**: `13.5.6` → `^14.2.0`
- **ESLint Config**: `13.5.6` → `^14.2.0`
- All other dependencies remain compatible

### 2. Verification Steps
✅ next.config.mjs - Compatible with Next.js 14
✅ tsconfig.json - Already using modern configuration  
✅ middleware.ts - Uses Next.js 13+ syntax
✅ App Router structure - Already implemented

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Run Automated Script (Recommended)
```bash
# On Windows
./fix-nextjs-upgrade.bat

# On Unix/Linux/Mac
chmod +x fix-nextjs-upgrade.sh
./fix-nextjs-upgrade.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Steps
```bash
# 1. Clean old dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json .next

# 2. Install new dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# 3. Test build locally
npm run build

# 4. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Update to Next.js 14 to fix Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

## What This Fixes

1. **Dependency Conflicts**: Resolves ERESOLVE errors in Vercel
2. **Build Compatibility**: Ensures all packages work together
3. **Future-Proofing**: Moves to actively supported Next.js version

## Next.js 14 Benefits

- **Improved Performance**: Better build times and runtime performance
- **Enhanced Security**: Latest security patches and improvements
- **Better Caching**: Improved app router caching strategies
- **Server Actions**: Enhanced server-side functionality (if needed later)

## Vercel Deployment

After running the fix:
1. Vercel will detect the new commit
2. Build should complete successfully
3. Website will be deployed with improved performance

## Rollback Plan (if needed)

If any issues arise, you can rollback by:
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

Then restore Next.js 13.5.6 in package.json and redeploy.

## Environment Variables

No changes needed to existing environment variables:
- All existing `.env` configurations remain valid
- Sanity integration continues to work
- EmailJS integration unchanged
- Database connections unaffected

## Testing Checklist

After deployment, verify:
- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] All service pages accessible
- [ ] Contact forms work
- [ ] Blog posts load (if implemented)
- [ ] Images display properly
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness maintained

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Test locally with `npm run dev`
3. Verify all environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard
4. Contact support if problems persist
